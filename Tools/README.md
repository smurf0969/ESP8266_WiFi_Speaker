# ImageToArray
This is a little tool I made to create the code array text to diplay an image on a 128px x 64px OLED display.
It should work on other sized images as long as the width and height are divisible by 8.
This is for Black & White images only so please use your favorite imaging software to convert/resize or make compatible images.
I have included my WiFi Speaker start screen for you to use as an example.
